#Write a program to find how many times substring “Emma” appears in the given string
c =0
a = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"
c = a.count("Emma")
print(c,"times")


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# I was thinking of iterating through the loop but this count method crossed my mind due to which code reduced to 1/3
