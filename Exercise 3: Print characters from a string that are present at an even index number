//Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

//For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’

word = input("enter your word : ")
print("your required output is : ")
for i in range(0,len(word),2):
    print(word[i])
    
// this is one way of doing this. you can try more ways and request to merge here ;)
